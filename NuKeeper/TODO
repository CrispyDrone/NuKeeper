The imported project "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" was not found.

	✓ Finish bitbucket template @done(2020-10-13 23:57) @project(templates)
	✓ Somehow, the commit message expresses that there are multiple updates, even though there's only 1 package being updated @context("chore: Update 5 packages") @done(2020-10-04 23:54) @project(bugs) @fix(forgot to use Clear in existing commit filter etc...)
	✘ properly support arrays, objects, delegates. Currently it seems impossible to pass a "json" argument `_delegates={ "50char": "..." }` on the command line @cancelled(2020-10-04 22:46) @project(cli) @reason(It probably is possible?? You just need perfect quoting, and I don't know how to do that for cmd)
	✓ is it fine to use `_delegates` in the configuration file? @reason(yes, delegates are special compared to arrays and objects since they need to be interpreted. Objects and arrays don't have to be interpreted by the csharp engine.) @done(2020-10-04 22:45) @project(design)
	✓ Test custom pull request title message @done(2020-10-04 22:45) @project(tests)
	✓ Test custom pull request body message @done(2020-10-04 22:45) @project(tests)
	✓ Test custom commit message @done(2020-10-04 22:45) @project(tests)
	✓ review the usage of enrichers + templates. How should they be used together? Should they both be taken as a dependency in the constructor,... @done(2020-08-30 14:37) @project(design)
	✓ Rethink the design __again__. A context enricher and the actual template __belong__ together?? @done(2020-08-26 18:24) @project(design)
	✓ write integration test for interpretation of file configuration + template rendering @done(2020-08-23 12:30) @project(tests)
